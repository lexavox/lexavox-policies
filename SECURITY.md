# Security Policy

**Last Updated:** January 15, 2026

## Data Security
*   **Encryption:** We use TLS/HTTPS for all data in transit between the app and cloud services.
*   **Storage:** User content is stored locally on your device using the operating system's sandboxed storage. We do not host user data on public servers.
*   **Access Control:** Access to cloud APIs (OCR, Translation, TTS) is secured via server-configured credentials that are not exposed in the client app code where possible.

## User Responsibility
*   **Device Security:** You are responsible for securing your device with a passcode, biometrics, or other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your stored history.
*   **Backups:** You are responsible for backing up your device data.

## Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability in LexaVox, please report it to security@lexavox.com. We appreciate your help in keeping our users safe.

## Privacy by Design
*   **Minimal Data:** We only collect diagnostics necessary for app stability.
*   **No Unauthorized Access:** We do not access your User Content unless explicitly initiated by you for processing.
