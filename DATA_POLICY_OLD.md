# Data Policy

## Data Types
*   **User Content:** Images, audio recordings, and text that you scan, upload, or generate.

*   **Requests:** You may contact us at [Insert Contact Email] to request data deletion in compliance with GDPR/CCPA.

## Training
*   **No Training:** We do not use your User Content to train our AI models.

## Sharing
*   **Processors:** We share data only with third-party processors (e.g., Google Gemini) strictly to fulfill your user-initiated requests (e.g., "Translate this page").
*   **No Sale:** We do not sell your data to third parties.
