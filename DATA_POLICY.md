## Data Types
*   **User Content:** Images, audio recordings, and text that you scan, upload, or generate.
*   **Age Range:** Age range selected during first-run verification (e.g., "13-17", "18-24") for COPPA compliance and age-appropriate content filtering.

## Storage

*   **Requests:** You may contact us at privacy@lexavox.com to request data deletion in compliance with GDPR/CCPA.

## Training
*   **No Training:** We do not use your User Content to train our AI models.

## Sharing
*   **Processors:** We share data only with third-party processors (e.g., Google Cloud services, Gemini API) strictly to fulfill your user-initiated requests (e.g., "Translate this page").
*   **No Sale:** We do not sell your data to third parties.
